This project is a Java-based honeypot that simulates a secure login system. The program is designed to look like a real authentication page, but it does not allow any successful login. Instead, it records all login attempts, including the entered username, password, and time of access, into a log file.

The main purpose of this project is to understand how attackers try to access systems and what kind of credentials they commonly use. By collecting and reviewing these login attempts, the project demonstrates how honeypots can be used in cybersecurity to monitor unauthorized activity in a safe and controlled environment.

This project was developed using core Java concepts such as input handling, file writing, and basic logging, making it suitable for beginners while still showing practical cybersecurity applications.
